# How It Works

1. If you're looking to find out whether or not your train is running on time...LOOK NO FURTHER!!! This is the page for you. 

2. We have a form on the page for you to fill out. The form contains/requests four items for you to enter in order to find how soon your locomotive will be arriving. 

3. The form includes the following items: Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, and Frequency. 

4. Fill in the template with the name of train you're looking to board, where you want it to take you, when the first train arrival is for said train, and how often it's running. 

5. After submitting your data and running through the algorithms inputed into our javascript which involves using moment.js to calculate the frequency of how often your train is coming to your location and when the next train is coming in minuntes. 

6. If you need to add another train for yourself, a family member, or friend, just input your data into the web form and watch the magic happen again!
